# Course Policies

## Goals

My primary goal for you is a tangible improvement in your skills, not "exposure" to a variety of topics. I would rather you only become a stronger JavaScript developer than have only looked at all of the course content.

## Engagement

Your attendance is expected at everything except lessons and work time. That means lesson attendance is **optional** and will not be recorded. If you're on a roll with other resources or have nothing to gain from the topic right now, please respect your own time and energy and sit the lesson out. You are also free to leave a lesson early if it's not working for you. Lessons are all recorded and will be posted for you to view later if you'd like. If you can't be present for an activity, please send me a DM.

You expected to submit all diagnostics and surveys. You are not required to submit exercises or questions, but you are **strongly** encouraged to do as much as you can. You will learn more from one round of feedback than you will passively consuming all of the content in the course.

Teaching a Zoom chat with a bunch of black squares is exhausting. As a courtesy to me, please keep your camera on unless you have a specific reason not to.

## Questions

* In lessons: No need to wait for a specific Q&A time, asking questions by voice or Zoom chat at any point in the lesson is encouraged!
* Use DMs for personal questions

Use [how to ask questions](/posts/how-to-ask-questions) for advice on phrasing questions.

## Submitting

Use the [submission form](https://forms.gle/fage8FMat1RwP1vP7) to get feedback on an exercise or question set. Remember to submit a publicly visible URL for GitHub, CodeSandbox, or a deployed site, not a private or Git URL.
